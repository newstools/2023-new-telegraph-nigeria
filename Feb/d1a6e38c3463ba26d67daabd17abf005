As the scarcity of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) persists with filling stations dispensing at prices that suit them, the Chairman, Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN), NNPC depot Ore, Western Zone of Nigeria, Engineer Shina Amoo, has raised the alarm that his members have not been benefitting from the N172 ex-depot price. Chairman, Ijegun-Egba Tankfarm Owners & Operators Association, Mr Debo Olujimi, had on Thursday in Lagos flagged off the sales of PMS at N172 ex-depot price by depot owners or tank farm owners to oil marketers. However, in an interview with New Telegraph on Monday, Amoo said they were still loading at between N250 and N275 per litre. He called on the Federal Government and the depot owners to make it possible for members of his zone to load at the promised N172 ex-depot price. Amoo said: “We have not been loading at N172 ex-depot price. They have not started that loading for us. We have not experienced that. We have been hearing that they will soon start but we have not had any price of N172 from any private depot till now. My chapter, as I talk to you, has not loaded anything as such. “We are still buying at a premium. There are some we paid long ago that we loaded weekend, and some of our marketers too loaded before the weekend at N250, and N260. The one I loaded on Saturday was being paid for since two weeks, it was N275 without transport. “They promised to load at N172 for us, but uptill now, we have not experienced that. We are still pleading with the govenrment to do the needful so that we can have enough volume in the system. The issue of crisis here and there will be stopped. “We pray that we should be benefiting from this N172 ex-depot price.” Meanwhile, a total of 502.21 million litres of PMS, otherwise called petrol, was evacuated between February 04 and 10, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPCL) said.
