   Fourth-placed Inter Milan’s Serie A title hopes took a hit after Luca Caldirola’s last-gasp equaliser earned lowly Monza a 2-2 draw at the Stadio Brianteo on Saturday. Inter went ahead through Matteo Darmian after 10 minutes when he met Alessandro Bastoni’s cross by getting ahead of his marker and tapping the ball in from close-range. Monza replied a minute later when Patrick Ciurria was found inside the box by Matteo Pessina and had just got enough time and space to curl the ball into the lower left corner. Lautaro Martinez then put Inter ahead again in the 22nd minute when he stole possession from Pablo Mari inside the area and fired the ball into the far corner. But Caldirola spoiled the party for Inter three minutes into stoppage time when he headed the equaliser from inside the box. Inter have 34 points from 17 games, seven adrift of leaders Napoli, who next visit Sampdoria, and two points behind third-placed AC Milan before they host AS Roma also on Sunday. Juventus are second on 37 points after beating Udinese 1-0 in Turin earlier on Saturday. *Courtesy: Reuters   Paulo Dybala shot Roma top of Serie A on Tuesday with a brace which sank Monza 3-0 while Inter Milan are one point behind Jose Mourinho's side after their 3-1 home win over Cremonese.
