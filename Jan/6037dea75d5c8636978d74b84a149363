  Lautaro Martinez equalised with two minutes of normal time left and Francesco Acerbi headed the winner deep into extra time as Inter Milan beat Parma 2-1 on Tuesday in the Italian Cup. Cup holders Inter fell behind to their visitors from Serie B Parma. Stanko Juric came on after 26 minutes to replace injured Dennis Man and smashed the opening goal from outside the penalty area after 38 minutes. Inter were without a host of possible starters, including Romelu Lukaku, Marcelo Brozovic, Samir Handanovic and Nicolo Barella. They failed to manage a strike on target in the first half to test 44-year-old goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon, who was returning for Parma after a long injury. Inter dominated possession in the second half but rarely threatened until World-Cup winner Martinez broke through and beat Buffon after 88 minutes. In the 110th minute, Acerbi, a second-half substitute, headed home the rebound after Buffon had saved to put Inter in the last eight where they will face Atalanta or La Spezia. *Courtesy: AFP   Internazionale put more pressure on the stuttering Serie A leaders Juventus when two goals by Romelu Lukaku and one from Alexis Sánchez gave them a 3-0 win at relegation-threatened Genoa on Saturday.
